Gym Fitness Website

This is a fully responsive and visually engaging gym fitness website, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a clean and modern black and white color scheme with yellow hover effects for an elegant and professional appearance.

The website includes several key sections:

Fitness Calculator: A tool allowing users to input personal details such as age, weight, height, and activity level to receive tailored fitness recommendations.
Membership Pricing Plans: Detailed pricing options including monthly, quarterly, yearly, and premium plans, each with a list of included features like gym access, personal training sessions, and nutritional consultations.
Interactive Navigation Menu: A dynamic, hover-responsive navigation bar allowing users to easily explore different sections of the site like "Home," "About Us," "Contact Us," and the fitness calculator.
This project demonstrates front-end development skills focused on creating an intuitive user experience, with smooth transitions, interactive elements, and a strong design aesthetic.
